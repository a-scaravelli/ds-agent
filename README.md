# kaggle-agent

An agent that does the iterative work of a data scientist on tabular Kaggle competitions, from downloading the data to the submission. The user approves only a short initial plan; then the agent works autonomously (validation/test holdout split, baseline, 10 improvement iterations by default, with early stop) and the user steps in at the end of the cycle: accept the report or give suggestions, which start a new cycle from the existing state. The model that reasons is headless Claude Code with the subscription (no paid API); it runs on a Mac without GPU.

Convention: the entire repository is in English (code, documentation, comments, tests, commit and PR messages).

## Current status

Design plus the first piece of code: the design document is in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) and the `proposals` subpackage of `kaggle_agent` holds the data model of plan, attempt and suggestion (ticket 1 of section 15 of the design). The other subpackages are still empty. There is no modeling logic yet.

## Stack

Python 3.12, pandas, scikit-learn, LightGBM and local MLflow are a starting point, not a constraint: libraries are chosen ticket by ticket, with the criteria of section 1 of the design. For this reason `pyproject.toml` declares no runtime dependencies, and the data model uses only the standard library.

## Data model (`kaggle_agent.proposals`)

All classes are immutable dataclasses. Invalid data raises `ValidationError` (a `ValueError` with `field` and `reason`), so the loop can pass the reason for a rejection back to the model.

- `ShortPlan`: the short initial plan with five mandatory items: `metric`, `validation`, `feature_engineering` (list), `models` (list) and `baseline`. Empty or wrongly typed items are rejected, and so are plans longer than `MAX_PLAN_WORDS` (300 words over the five items).
- `Attempt`: a falsifiable hypothesis. Mandatory and non-empty: `id`, `phase`, `hypothesis`, `rationale`, `what_changed`, `measure`. Optional: `parent_id` (different from `id`), `evidence`, `exploratory`, `expected_effect`, `estimated_cost`, `risks`, `artifacts`. An attempt without `evidence` must have `exploratory=True`, otherwise it is rejected.
- `Suggestion`: `id`, `text`, `origin_cycle` and `spawned_cycles` (no duplicates, never containing `origin_cycle`).

Each class has `to_dict`, `from_dict`, `to_json` and `from_json`. Rereading gives an identical object, the JSON is deterministic, and unknown keys or malformed JSON are rejected with `ValidationError`.

```python
from kaggle_agent.proposals import Attempt, ShortPlan, Suggestion, ValidationError

plan = ShortPlan(
    metric="official competition metric",
    validation="partitions that mimic the train/test separation",
    feature_engineering=["missing-value indicators"],
    models=["boosted trees"],
    baseline="simple model with default parameters",
)
assert ShortPlan.from_json(plan.to_json()) == plan

try:
    Attempt.from_dict({"id": "T-1", "phase": "iteration", "hypothesis": "h",
                       "rationale": "r", "measure": "m", "exploratory": True})
except ValidationError as error:
    print(error)  # what_changed: is required
```

## Deliverable and traceability

The output of every cycle is an end-to-end Python pipeline that runs with a single command and is reproducible (or several pipelines, to compare variants), linked to the attempt it comes from. Every attempt records hypothesis and rationale, originating attempt and what changed, configuration, metrics, duration, outcome and artifacts; a web interface (list/timeline, metric chart, detail, suggestions and cycles) makes them consultable without reading code. The polished graphic design is deferred to a later ticket.

## Installation and tests

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e '.[dev]'
.venv/bin/pytest -q
```

The tests do not use the network.

## Structure

- `docs/design.md`: design in 16 sections (cycle, frozen evaluation, registry, Kaggle, ticket plan).
- `src/kaggle_agent/`: package with the subpackages `loop`, `proposals` (data model), `evaluation`, `registry`, `kaggle`, `llm`, `sandbox`, `review`, `budget`; all but `proposals` are empty.
- `tests/`: check the 16 sections of the design, the data model and its examples, the language convention, the test map, that the package imports, and that outside `proposals` there is no logic or third-party dependency.

## Known limits

- There is still no runnable command of the agent: only the data model exists.
- The tests on the design check structure and keywords, not the quality of the content. The language test is a heuristic (Italian function words and identifiers), not a proof that every sentence is English.
- The word count of the plan (split on whitespace) is a simple proxy for "one page". `id` and `phase` have no format constraints yet: they belong to the registry and loop tickets.
- The test that forbids third-party dependencies will have to be relaxed when the development tickets arrive.
